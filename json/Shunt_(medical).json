The term may describe\neither congenital or acquired shunts; and acquired shunts (sometimes referred to\nas iatrogenic shunts) may be either or .\n\n* Cardiac shunts may be described as right-to-left, left-to-right or\n  bidirectional, or as systemic-to-pulmonary or pulmonary-to-systemic.\n\n* Cerebral shunt: In cases of hydrocephalus and other conditions that cause\n  chronic increased intracranial pressure, a one-way valve is used to drain\n  excess cerebrospinal fluid from the brain and carry it to other parts of the\n  body. This valve usually sits outside the skull, but beneath the skin,\n  somewhere behind the ear.\n\n* Lumbar-peritoneal shunt: In cases of chronic increased intracranial pressure\n  such as Idiopathic intracranial hypertension and Hydrocephalus, a tube or\n  shunt with or without a one-way valve is used to drain the excess\n  cerebrospinal fluid from the brain and transport it to the peritoneal cavity,\n  which is a cavity located in the abdomen area of the body. This shunt is\n  usually inserted in between two of the vertebrae in the lumbar and punctures\n  the cerebrospinal fluid sack or lumbar subarachnoid space, it then runs\n  beneath the skin to the peritoneal cavity, where it is eventually drained away\n  by the normal bodily fluid drainage system.\n  [http://www.medtronic.com/neurosurgery/shunts.html#lumbo For an example of a\n  Lumbar-peritoneal/Lumboperitoneal shunt].\n\n* A Peritoneovenous shunt: (also called 'Denver shunt' [http://medical-\n  dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/Denver+shunt thefreedictionary.com > Denver\n  shunt] Citing: McGraw-Hill Concise Dictionary of Modern Medicine. Â©\n  2002 ) is a shunt which drains peritoneal fluid from the peritoneum into\n  veins, usually the internal jugular vein or the superior vena cava. It is\n  sometimes used in patients with refractory ascites. It is a long tube with a\n  non-return valve running subcutaneously from the peritoneum to the internal\n  jugular vein in the neck, which allows ascitic fluid to pass directly into the\n  systemic circulation\n\nPossible Complications\n# Infection Superior vena caval thrombosis Pulmonary edema bleeding from varices\n# DIC(Disseminated intravascular coagulopathy)\n\n* Pulmonary shunts exist when there is normal perfusion to an alveolus, but\n  ventilation fails to supply the perfused region.\n\n* A portosystemic shunt (PSS), also known as a liver shunt, is a bypass of the\n  liver by the body's circulatory system. It can be either a congenital or\n  acquired condition. Congenital PSS is an uncommon condition in dogs and cats,\n  found mainly in small dog breeds such as Miniature Schnauzers and Yorkshire\n  Terriers, and in cats such as Persians, Himalayans, and mix breeds. Acquired\n  PSS is also uncommon and is found in older dogs with liver disease causing\n  portal hypertension, especially cirrhosis.\n\n* A portacaval shunt/ portal caval shunt is a treatment for high blood pressure\n  in the liver.\n\n*'Vesicoamniotic shunting procedure'\n","linknr":156,"url":"Shunt_(medical)","recorded":1362575978,"links":25,"instances":["cat","physiology","electrical","cat"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Implants"],"headings":["See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4a/Phonocardiograms_from_normal_and_abnormal_heart_sounds.png/200px-Phonocardiograms_from_normal_and_abnormal_heart_sounds.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e3/Rod_of_Asclepius2.svg/9px-Rod_of_Asclepius2.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["ventilation","physiology"],["persian","cat"],["himalayan","cat"],["shunt","electrical"]],"members":["himalayan","ventilation","shunt","persian"],"related":["Medicine","Bodily_fluid","Human_anatomy","Congenital","Acquired","Iatrogenic","Cardiac_shunt","Cerebral_shunt","Hydrocephalus","Intracranial_pressure","One-way_valve","Cerebrospinal_fluid","Brain","Human_skull","Skin","Ear","Lumbar-peritoneal_shunt","Intracranial_pressure","Idiopathic_intracranial_hypertension","Hydrocephalus","One-way_valve","Cerebrospinal_fluid","Brain","Shunt","Skin","Peritoneovenous_shunt","Peritoneal_fluid","Peritoneum","Vein","Internal_jugular_vein","Superior_vena_cava","Ascites","Pulmonary_edema","Pulmonary_shunt","Perfusion","Alveolus","Ventilation_(physiology)","Portosystemic_shunt","Liver","Circulatory_system","Miniature_Schnauzer","Yorkshire_Terrier","Persian_(cat)","Himalayan_(cat)","Portal_hypertension","Cirrhosis","Portacaval_shunt","Shunt_(electrical)","Ammeter"]}
