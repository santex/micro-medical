A mismatch between\noxygen supply and its demand at the cellular level may result in a hypoxic\ncondition. Hypoxia in which there is complete deprivation of oxygen supply is\nreferred to as 'anoxia'.\n\nHypoxia differs from hypoxemia in that, in the latter, the oxygen concentration\nwithin the arterial blood is abnormally low. It is possible to\nexperience hypoxia and have a low oxygen content (e.g., due to anemia) but\nmaintain high oxygen partial pressure (p). Incorrect use of these terms can\neasily lead to confusion, especially as hypoxemia is among the causes of hypoxia\n(in hypoxemic hypoxia).\n\nGeneralized hypoxia occurs in healthy people when they ascend to high altitude,\nwhere it causes altitude sickness leading to potentially fatal complications:\nhigh altitude pulmonary edema (HAPE) and high altitude cerebral edema\n(HACE). Hypoxia also occurs in healthy\nindividuals when breathing mixtures of gases with a low oxygen content, e.g.\nwhile diving underwater especially when using closed-circuit rebreather systems\nthat control the amount of oxygen in the supplied air. A mild and non-damaging\nintermittent hypoxia is used intentionally during altitude trainings to develop\nan athletic performance adaptation at both the systemic and cellular\nlevel.\n\nHypoxia is also a serious consequence of preterm birth in the neonate. The main\ncause for this is that the lungs of the human fetus are among the last organs to\ndevelop during pregnancy. To assist the lungs to distribute oxygenated blood\nthroughout the body, infants at risk of hypoxia are often placed inside an\nincubator capable of providing continuous positive airway pressure (also known\nas a humidicrib).\n\nIn humans, hypoxia is detected by chemoreceptors in the carotid body. This\nresponse does not control ventilation rate at normal p, but below normal the\nactivity of neurons innervating these receptors increases dramatically, so much\nso to override the signals from central chemoreceptors in the hypothalamus,\nincreasing p despite a falling p\n","linknr":592,"url":"Hypoxia_(medical)","recorded":1362482255,"links":55,"instances":["heart","medical"],"pdf":["http://www.airbus.com/store/mm_repository/pdf/att00007996/media_object_file_FAST38_Hypoxia.pdf"],"categories":["Aviation medicine","Diving medicine","Mountaineering and health","Oxygen","Pulmonology"],"headings":["Classification","Signs and symptoms","Pathophysiology","Treatment","See also","References","Bibliography"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/dc/Cynosis.JPG/220px-Cynosis.JPG","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5e/Helmet_logo_for_Underwater_Diving_portal.png/20px-Helmet_logo_for_Underwater_Diving_portal.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/81/SpongeDiver.jpg/100px-SpongeDiver.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["shunt","medical"],["ventricle","heart"]],"members":["ventricle","shunt"],"related":["Cyanosis","Pathology","Oxygen","Hypoxemia","Hypoxemic_hypoxia","High_altitude","Altitude_sickness","High_altitude_pulmonary_edema","HAPE","High_altitude_cerebral_edema","HACE","Rebreather","Altitude_training","Preterm_birth","Continuous_positive_airway_pressure","Carotid_body","Hypothalamus","Hypoventilation","Respiratory_failure","Opiates","Shunt_(medical)","Alveoli","Smallest_cardiac_veins","Ventricle_(heart)","Bronchi","Ventilation/perfusion_ratio","Pulmonary_embolism","Alveolar-arterial_gradient","Partial_pressure","Atmosphere","Anesthesia","Fink_effect","Cyanide_poisoning","Altitude_sickness","Headache","Nausea","Seizure","Coma","Priapism","Cyanosis","Haemoglobin","Deoxyhaemoglobin","Oxyhaemoglobin","Artery","Mitochondria","Cytoplasm","Hydrogen","Glucose","Fat","Amino_acid","Water","Pyruvic_acid","Lactic_acid","Vasodilation","Lungs","Vasoconstriction","Hypoxic_pulmonary_vasoconstriction","Acclimatization","Hyperventilation","Chronic_obstructive_pulmonary_disease","Polycythemia","Oxygen_concentrator","Altitude_training","Anoxia","Asphyxia","Cerebral_hypoxia","Deep_water_blackout","Drowning","G-LOC","Hypoxic_tumor","Hypoxicator","Ischemia","Hyperoxia","Sleep_apnea","Intermittent_hypoxic_training","Shallow_water_blackout","Time_of_useful_consciousness","1999_South_Dakota_Learjet_crash","Payne_Stewart","2000_Australia_Beechcraft_King_Air_crash","Helios_Flight_522","Soyuz_11","Airbus"]}
